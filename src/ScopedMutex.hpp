/**
 * @brief Constructs a ScopedMutex object from `SemaphoreHandle_t` `m` and attempts to acquire the mutex.
 *
 * Guarantees mutex release when the `ScopedMutex` object goes out of scope.
 *
 * This class prevents deadlocks by ensuring that the mutex is always released,
 * even if exceptions are thrown or the code exits early.
 *
 * @param m The FreeRTOS semaphore handle.
 * @param timeout The timeout in FreeRTOS ticks. Defaults to portMAX_DELAY (indefinite blocking).
 * @note -  If no timeout is specified, the mutex acquisition will block indefinitely and is guaranteed to return an acquired mutex.
 *
 *       -  If a timeout is provided, the `acquired()` method should be used to check if the mutex was successfully acquired.
 *
 * Example use:
 * ```cpp
 * // No timeout (blocks indefinitely):
 * {
 *     ScopedMutex lock(myMutex); // Mutex guaranteed to be acquired (blocks)
 * 
 *     // Access shared resource here...
 * 
 * } // Mutex automatically released
 * 
 * // With timeout:
 * {
 *     ScopedMutex lock(myMutex, pdMS_TO_TICKS(10));
 * 
 *     if (lock.acquired()) { // Check if acquired!
 * 
 *         // Access shared resource here...
 * 
 *     } else {
 * 
 *         // Handle timeout (e.g., log error, retry later)
 * 
 *     }
 * } // Mutex automatically released
 *
 * ```
